# Animal-shelter-prediction
Multiclass prediction of outcome of animals at animal shelter
The Austin Animal Center is the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States that provides care and shelter to over 18,000 animals each year and is involved in a range of county, city, and state-wide initiatives for the protection and care of abandoned, at-risk, and surrendered animals.

As part of the City of Austin Open Data Initiative, the Austin Animal Center makes available its collected dataset that contains statistics and outcomes of animals entering the Austin Animal Services system.

This is my first attempt at this dataset and accuracy is about 65% with default hyper paramters. I have used XBG boost classifier. Going to explore other classifiers and most probably preprocess some of the columns in the dataset in a different way.
